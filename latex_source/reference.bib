It can be regarded as a device that represents a sequence, a reordering, or a grid of points. In addition, its space adapts to various entropy measures of the data it encodes, enabling compressed representations. New competitive solutions to a number of problems, based on wavelet trees, are appearing every year. In this survey we give an overview of wavelet trees and the surprising number of applications in which we have found them useful: basic and weighted point grids, sets of rectangles, strings, permutations, binary relations, graphs, inverted indexes, document retrieval indexes, full-text indexes, XML indexes, and general numeric sequences.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, the world is becoming increasingly connected. The following dire need for understanding both the relationships amongst individuals and the global structural characteristics brings forward the study of network sciences and many interdisciplinary subjects in recent years. As a result, it is crucial to have methods and algorithms that help us to unveil the structural properties of a network. Over the past few decades, many essential algorithms have been developed by scientists from many different fields. This review will focus on one of the most widely used methods called the k-core decomposition. The k-core decomposition is to find the largest subgraph of a network, in which each node has at least k neighbors in the subgraph. The most commonly used algorithm to perform k-core decomposition is a pruning process that to recursively remove the nodes that have degrees less than k. The algorithm was firstly proposed by Seidman in 1983 and soon became one of the most popular algorithms to detect the network structure due to its simplicity and broad applicability. This algorithm is widely adopted to find the densest part of a network across a broad range of scientific subjects including biology, network science, computer science, ecology, economics, social sciences, etc., so to achieve the vital knowledge under different contexts. Besides, a few physicists find that an exciting phase transition emerges with various critical behaviors during the pruning process. This review aims at filling the gap by making a comprehensive review of the theoretical advances on k-core decomposition problem, along with a review of a few applications of the k-core decomposition from many interdisciplinary perspectives.}

abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},
