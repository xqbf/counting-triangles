\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we study the problem of efficiently counting $\delta$-temporal triangles in large temporal graphs.
%
We first propose an online algorithm \OTTC by counting the $\delta$-temporal triangles sharing the vertices of each triangle in the static graph.
%
Afterward, we develop an efficient index-based solution that maps $\delta$-temporal triangles into 2-dimensional points and compactly organizes them in a tree structure.
%
Besides, we study efficient algorithms for binary $\delta$-temporal triangle counting.
%
Experiments on both real and synthetic large temporal graphs show that \OTTC is up to 70$\times$ faster than the SOTA algorithm, and our index-based algorithm is up to $10^8\times$ faster than online algorithms.
%
In the future, we will study how to apply our algorithms to directed graphs and try to develop fast approximation algorithms through the sampling-based method.
